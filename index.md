These evenings will start with talks which will then be followed by an open discussion and snacks.

The talks will be given by you! [Fill out this super short form to contribute](https://forms.gle/8smq5CGJw1hqsLkK8){:target="\_blank"}. This can be as simple as picking a news story, forum post, paper, book, or podcast episode and talking about it for 2-10 minutes. But you can also sign up to give a longer talk (10-30min) if you want to go into depth on something!
