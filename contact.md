_As of September 2024, the only actively maintained sources of information are this website and [the EA forum page](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/groups/YjhuGBkHCQbZsTdzW){:target="\_blank"}._

There are still a few social media accounts left over from the EA Sheffield university group which no longer exists.

You can contact us at [effective.altruism.sheffield@gmail.com](mailto:effective.altruism.sheffield@gmail.com){:target="\_blank"}.

The EA Sheffield city group was restarted and is currently being run by [Amanda Matthes](https://amanda-matthes.github.io){:target="\_blank"}.
